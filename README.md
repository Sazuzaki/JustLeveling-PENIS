# JustLeveling Fork
This repo is a fork of the [JustLeveling](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/just-leveling) mod for minecraft forge 1.20.1

## Why the fork?
The original mod does have a lot of great features, but sadly it has a lot of performance issues and bugs too, when searching for new versions or news about a future update I found out that it wasn't happening due to the original creator `Dplayend` loosing the source code for the original mod, that's why I took on the task of decompiling the code shipped on the .dll, then fixed performance issues along with some bugs and released it to the public so anyone searching for a new version of this mod can use this.
Feel free to contribute to it, so we can make this fork a better version of what originally was ^^
